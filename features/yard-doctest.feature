Feature: yard doctest
  In order to avoid creating separated from code tests
  And to keep my code examples correct and meaningful
  As a developer
  I want to automatically parse YARD's @example tags
  And use them as tests
  Just like doctest in Python

  Scenario: adds new command to yard
    When I run `bundle exec yard --help`
    Then the output should contain "doctest  Doctests from @example tags"

  Scenario: looks for files in app/lib directories by default
    Given a file named "doctest_helper.rb" with:
      """
      require 'app/app'
      require 'lib/lib'
      """
    And a file named "app/app.rb" with:
      """
      # @example
      #   sum(2, 2) #=> 4
      def sum(one, two)
        one + two
      end
      """
    And a file named "lib/lib.rb" with:
      """
      # @example
      #   sub(2, 2) #=> 0
      def sub(one, two)
        one - two
      end
      """
    When I run `bundle exec yard doctest`
    Then the output should contain "2 runs, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips"

  Scenario Outline: looks for files only in passed glob
    Given a file named "doctest_helper.rb" with:
      """

      """
    When I run `bundle exec yard doctest <glob>`
    Then the output should contain "1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips"
